## Test Driven Development
This exercise is to reinforce your JavaScript understanding with test-driven development (TDD).

First run `npm install` to install Mocha and Chai. To run your tests, cd to the root directory.  Then run:
`npm test`

The basic framework for writing tests is already set up.  After two simple examples, students must write their own tests! NOTE: Solve a function only after you've written the tests for it.

## Document Your Functions
The first two functions in index.js are already annotated (with inputs/outputs etc.).  Please annotate the rest of your functions.
