## Test Driven Development
This exercise is to reinforce your JavaScript understanding with test-driven development (TDD).

To run your tests, cd to the root directory.  Then run:
`npm test`

The basic framework for writing tests is already set up.  After two simple examples, students must write their own tests!

## Document Your Functions
Below is an example of how to annotate your functions.  

`/**
 * @name: functionName
 * @description what does your function do??  Explain plainly.
 * @param: what is your function's input?
 * @return: what does your function return?
 **/`
